# Version 0.0.1

This initial version consists of two main components: the Fan-Body.stl and the Power-Part.stl. These parts are assembled using two M4 screws and a small amount of CA glue for added stability.

The Hose-connector.stl is printed separately in a vertical orientation to enhance strength and durability. The 40mm-NATO-connector.stl is attached to the Fan-Body.stl using four M4 screws. While it can also be glued, it's intentionally screwed in to simplify the Fan-Body.stl print and to allow for easy replacementâ€”potentially with a bayonet-style connector in future iterations.

The Power-Part is designed to be modular and will be updated to support batteries from other brands such as Makita, Metabo, Milwaukee, and more.
