# Version 0.0.1

This initial version consists of two main components: the Fan-Body.stl and the Power-Part.stl. These parts are assembled using two M4 screws and a small amount of CA glue for added stability.

The Hose-connector.stl is printed separately in a vertical orientation to enhance strength and durability. The 40mm-NATO-connector.stl is attached to the Fan-Body.stl using four M4 screws. While it can also be glued, it's intentionally screwed in to simplify the Fan-Body.stl print and to allow for easy replacement—potentially with a bayonet-style connector in future iterations.

The Power-Part is designed to be modular and will be updated to support batteries from other brands such as Makita, Metabo, Milwaukee, and more.

For 3M masks like the 6200 you can add a bayonet cover like this one from [Přemek Marek](https://www.printables.com/model/150650-shigematsu-bayonet-cover-zatka-na-bajonet-shigemat/files), Further to connect the hose to the 3M mask you can use this connector from [tygunn](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:4605251).
